Bootcamp 2021: Abstract animated shapes

My name is Ioannis Panagiotidis and I am originally from Greece.

This project is demonstrating what I have learned throughout a 2 week bootcamp training at City University. In order to create it, I have used variables, if statements, for loops, multiple shapes with or without movement and many comments which are a key feature for the understanding of each line of code.
